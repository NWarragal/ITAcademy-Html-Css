            <p class="p"><br><br>The Formula One series originated with the European Grand Prix Motor Racing (q.v. for pre-1947
                history)
                of the 1920s and 1930s.<br><br> The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet.<br><br> Formula One
                was a new formula agreed upon after World War II during 1946, with the first non-championship races
                being held that year. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world
                championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers'
                Championship was not formalised until 1947. The first world championship race was held at Silverstone,
                United Kingdom in 1950.<br><br> A championship for constructors followed in 1958. National championships existed
                in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held for
                many years, but due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.<br><br> On 26
                November 2017, Formula One unveiled its new logo, following the 2017 season finale in Abu Dhabi during
                the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit. The new logo replaced F1's iconic 'flying one', which
                had been the sport's trademark since 1993</p>

            <p class="p">A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It begins with two free practice sessions on
                Friday (except in Monaco, where Friday practices are moved to Thursday), and one free practice on
                Saturday.<br><br> Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only
                two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up his seat. A qualifying session is held
                after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.

            <p class="p">For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions;
                drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order
                determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on pole position. Grids were generally
                limited to 26 cars â€“ if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would
                start the race.<br><br> During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing
                teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main
                qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting
                with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each
                driver only one qualifying lap.<br><br> The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known
                as "knock-out" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3.<br><br> In each period,
                drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being
                "knocked out" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid
                positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps
                as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap
                in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be
                completed, and will count toward that driver's placement.<br><br> The number of cars eliminated in each period
                is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship. Currently, with 20 cars, Q1
                runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers.<br><br> During this period, any driver whose best
                lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without
                permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting
                positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3.<br><br> In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15
                minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period.<br><br> Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes
                and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016
                Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90
                seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions
                for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese
                GP, after running the format for only two races.<br><br> Each car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set
                of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1
                or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start
                the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of
                wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<br><br> All of the drivers
                that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that
                affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving
                infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a
                car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the
                race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.</p>

            <p class="p">The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the
                order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation
                with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided he has not
                fallen to the back of the field).<br><br> The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and
                their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time
                to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.Once all the cars have formed on the grid, a light
                system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of
                one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than
                3 seconds) to signal the start of the race.<br><br> The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on
                the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap
                begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a
                serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from
                behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely
                heavy rainfall.<br><br> As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall
                a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will
                form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.Under
                normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having
                completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to
                unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only
                likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the
                race.

                In the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was
                reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardised to the
                current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989. However, street races like Monaco have shorter distances, to keep under
                the two-hour limit.

                Drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race and are "Classified" in the
                order they finished 90% of the race distance. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who
                has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling him he is obliged to allow the
                leader to overtake him. The slower car is said to be "lapped" and, once the leader finishes the race, is
                classified as finishing the race "one lap down". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in
                front of him. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other
                reason is said to have retired from the race and is "Not Classified" in the results.<br><br> However, if the
                driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, he will be classified. Throughout the race,
                drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could
                also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise
                their car's potential.<br><br> Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics,
                are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available
                compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which
                compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls;
                this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of
                two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one "intermediate", for mild wet conditions,
                such as after recent rain, one "full wet", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make
                at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further
                stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers
                are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.
